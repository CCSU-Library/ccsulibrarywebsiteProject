## 1. Custom Plugin: "CCSU Mega Menu"

To provide advanced functionality in a portable and maintainable way, we created a dedicated plugin named `ccsu-mega-menu`. This plugin is responsible for all major feature enhancements beyond standard theme presentation.

### Key Features:

#### a. Block-Based Mega Menus

* **Functionality:** Allows administrators to build complex, multi-column dropdown menus using the native WordPress Block Editor.

* **Implementation:**

    * A **"Mega Menus" Custom Post Type** was created. Users can go to `Mega Menus > Add New` to build a menu layout with any combination of blocks (columns, headings, images, text, etc.).

    * A **"Mega Menu Content" dropdown** was added to the `Appearance > Menus` screen. This allows an administrator to assign a saved block layout to any top-level menu item.

    * A **Custom Nav Walker (`Our_Mega_Menu_Walker`)** was developed. This PHP class extends the theme's default Bootstrap Navwalker. It intelligently detects when a menu item has a mega menu assigned and replaces the standard dropdown with the rendered block content.

#### b. Dynamic Header Content

* **Functionality:** Replaces the static, hard-coded content in the homepage header (title, tagline, search form) with a fully editable block-based section.

* **Implementation:**

    * A **"Header Content" Custom Post Type** was added to the plugin. Users can go to `Header Content > Add New` to build the overlay content for the homepage slideshow.

    * A **Customizer Control** was added under `Appearance > Customize > Header Slideshow` that allows the user to select which "Header Content" post to display.

    * The `header.php` template was updated to dynamically render the selected block content, providing full control over the header's layout to the site administrator.

## 2. Theme Customizations

Significant modifications were made to the `wp-bootstrap-starter` theme files to integrate our custom features and resolve conflicts.

### Key Features:

#### a. Custom Header Slideshow

* **Functionality:** Replaced the theme's broken "Header Banner" feature with a stable, custom-built slideshow.

* **Implementation:**

    * A **"Header Slideshow" section** was added to the `Appearance > Customize` screen. It includes controls for uploading up to 6 images.

    * The old "Header Banner" section was programmatically removed to avoid confusion.

    * The `header.php` file was modified to fetch these images and render them as a CSS-animated, cross-fading background slideshow on the homepage.

    * The animation duration and delays are calculated dynamically in PHP based on the number of images uploaded, ensuring a smooth presentation.

#### b. Dynamic Logos for Navigation Bars

* **Functionality:** Allows administrators to upload unique logos for the topmost utility bar and the secondary navigation bar via the Customizer.

* **Implementation:**

    * A **"Custom Logos" section** was added to the `Appearance > Customize` screen with two image upload controls.

    * The `header.php` file was updated to check if a logo has been set for each location and display it. If no logo is set, it provides a graceful fallback (e.g., displaying the site title).

## 3. Major Bug Fixes & Troubleshooting

We systematically diagnosed and resolved several complex issues.

#### a. Resolved: Persistent Fatal Error in WordPress Customizer

* **Symptom:** A fatal `TypeError: array_merge(): Argument #3 must be of type array, false given` would crash the Customizer, especially on the Multisite subsite.

* **Diagnosis:** Through a process of elimination (checking `functions.php`, `customizer.php`, other theme files, plugins, and the database), we determined the root cause was faulty data being passed to the Customizer's widget registration function.

* **Solution:** We identified and removed leftover experimental widget code from the theme's `functions.php` file and corrected errors in the `inc/customizer.php` file where core WordPress sections were being improperly re-declared.

#### b. Resolved: Fatal Error on Image Cropping

* **Symptom:** Attempting to crop an image in the "Header Banner" section resulted in a `DivisionByZeroError`.

* **Diagnosis:** The theme was not correctly providing `width` and `height` dimensions to the WordPress image cropping tool.

* **Solution:** We bypassed the broken feature entirely by implementing our own custom slideshow functionality, which does not rely on the theme's faulty header image implementation.

#### c. Resolved: Navigation Bar Responsive & Stacking Issues

* **Symptom:** Navigation menus were stacking vertically on all screen sizes, toggler buttons were invisible, and dropdowns were losing their styling.

* **Diagnosis:** The `<nav>` elements were missing the necessary `navbar-expand-lg` class to control their collapse breakpoint. The HTML structure was also incorrect, preventing proper flexbox alignment and causing CSS conflicts.

* **Solution:** We rebuilt the `header.php` navbar structures to follow Bootstrap 4 best practices, adding the correct classes (`navbar-expand-lg`, `navbar-dark`), ensuring unique IDs for collapsible elements, and using flexbox utilities (`d-flex`, `justify-content-between`) to manage the layout of the split navigation bar.

This documentation provides a clear overview of the custom architecture and the solutions implemented to create a stable, flexible, and user-friendly theme.
